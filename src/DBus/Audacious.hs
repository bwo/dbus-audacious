-- Module: Dbus.Audacious
-- 
-- Dbus interface to Audacious (which does not conform exactly, or
-- solely, to the MPRIS standard). Note that currently only making
-- method calls is possible; listening for signals is not yet
-- available.
-- 
-- Note that 'player' and /all/ the functions in the 'Aud' monad may
-- raise exceptions. A specialized 'try' is provided in this module
-- which will only catch 'ConnectionError's, so that one may do
-- something like:
-- 
-- > try $ player >>= runAud ...
-- 
-- allowing other exceptions to propagate through.
-- 
-- The official dbus interface to audacious returns or accepts numeric
-- types sometimes as signed and sometimes as unsigned integers. It is
-- not always obvious /why/ that should be the case. (Several methods
-- differ solely in returning signed or unsigned integers.) This
-- module uniformly returns and accepts signed integers. The practical
-- effect of this should, generally, be nil: a playlist is unlikely to
-- have 2^31 entries in it, nor is a track likely be that many
-- milliseconds long, etc. On the other hand, audacious will return
-- 2^32 - 1 to indicate error or \"no response\" from methods like
-- QueueGetQueuePos (if, for instance, the queue has length 3, and one
-- asks for the position of the track at queue position 4). But, even
-- if it is practically never going to occur, it is /theoretically/
-- possibel that a queue should have that many entries.
-- 
-- All functions here return -1 to indicate such an error, where
-- relevant; such functions also have equivalents, ending in \"M\", that
-- call 'throwError' in the event of an error.
-- 
-- Two examples. To remove everything from the current playlist's
-- playqueue, opening the enqueued files in a new playlist instead,
-- and playing them there:
-- 
-- > p <- player
-- > withPlayer p $ do 
-- >     qps <- allQueuePos
-- >     fns <- mapM songFilename qps
-- >     mapM_ queueRemove qps
-- >     setShuffle False
-- >     openListToTemp fns
-- >     jump 0 -- last two lines not strictly necessary
-- >     play
-- 
-- To stop playing after the current track and all queued tracks have
-- played, doing this in a different thread:
-- 
-- > p <- player withPlayer p $ do 
-- >    t <- (+) <$> remaining <*> (fmap sum (allQueuePos >>= mapM songFrames)) 
-- >    let micros = 1000 * fromIntegral t
-- >    liftIO $ forkIO (threadDelay micros >> withPlayer p stop) 
-- 
-- Note that the names of the functions exposed by this module do not
-- always directly correspond to the names of the methods exposed
-- over dbus, in large part because the latter seem to be highly
-- non-systematic. Some derived functions are included.

-- The advantage of the above monad stack is that *within* Aud
-- computations, one needn't thread a Player object through; that is,
-- as in the examples above, one can just do "jump 0 >> play" rather
-- than "jump p 0 >> play p", which is ugly. However, if one isn't
-- going to call "player" frequently to get a fresh Player object, and
-- if one uses the Aud monad in many places, one will still have to
-- thread the player object around to pass it into
-- runAud/withPlayer. This can be made easier using another layer of
-- Reader (or State). However, an alternate approach would be to do
-- something like this:
-- 
-- thePlayer :: IORef (Maybe Player)
-- thePlayer = unsafePerformIO $ newIORef Nothing
-- getPlayer :: IO Player -- as "player" below
-- player :: IO Player
-- player = do
--   mp <- readIORef p

--             pl <- getPlayer
--             writeIORef p $ Just pl
--             return pl
-- 
-- then "ask" in realMakecall below would be replaced by "player".
-- It would then be possible to keep Aud as a distinct type, though
-- there would be no reason to have it be the type it presently is (it
-- could just be a newtype around IO), and to replace runAud with
-- something with the signature of runAud', since there would be no
-- reason to pass in the Player object, which is stashed in a global
-- IORef. Or Aud could just be replaced with IO directly.
-- While perhaps neater, though, I find the use of the global there
-- kind of icky.
